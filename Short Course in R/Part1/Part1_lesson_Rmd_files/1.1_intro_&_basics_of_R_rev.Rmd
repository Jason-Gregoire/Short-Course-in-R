# 1.1: Introduction and Basics of R 

## What is R. 

* R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. R generally comes with the Command-line interface and is available across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

### Why should I learn R? 
* Programming is used as a leading tool for machine learning, statistics, and data analysis. 

* Objects, functions, and packages can easily be created by R.
* It’s an open-source free language. 
* R is not only a statistic package, but also allows us to integrate with other languages (C, C++). Thus, you can easily interact with many data sources and statistical packages.
* R has a vast and growing community of users.
* R is one of the most requested programming languages in the Data Science job market.

### There are lots of online resources for learning R

* Official 'R' Foundation: https://www.r-project.org/ 
* Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN): https://cran.r-project.org/
  + Download the R language and basic Command-Line Environment
* The Official R-Manuals: https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html
* R Markdown Cheatsheet!! https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf
* See reference for all source material for this short course within its GitHub readme.md

### Programming Languages: Compiled vs. Interpreted
**R is an Interpreted Language. What does that mean?**

* It's a little slower at time of execution (but there are ways to improve this)
* It has the ability to interact in a call-and-response manner (like Matlab)  
* R is really great for rapid prototyping and quickly getting something up and running.

### Interacting with the basic R Interpreter
Once you have the R environment installed and setup: 

(1) Open the terminal/shell 

(2) Once at the command line, type: `R`

This will launch R interpreter and you will get a prompt `>` where you can start coding.  

  ```{R}
  myString <- "Hello, World!"
  print (myString)
  ```
(3) To close out of R (but remain in the terminal/shell), hit control-d on your keyboard or type `exit()`. The `$` prompt should return. 

**Note**: that when you exit, all R variables/values are erased from memory.

### A better environment: The offical R integrated development environment: **R-Studio**

* An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development.

*R Studio*, R's official IDE, is available as both Open Source and Commercial software and can be downloaded from its official Website: `www.rstudio.com`

*R Studio* is powerful and easy to set up and use. 

![R-Studio U/I](https://res.cloudinary.com/data-science-dojo/image/upload/v1527878589/rstudio2_gy2jzi.png)


*R Studio* has a three panels:

* A Console panel: type and execute R code 
* An Environmental/History panel. displays generated variables and a session log of executed commands
* A Multiple Tool Panel: displays loaded files, generated plots, available packages, help section, and a web viewer.

**Note**: *Jupyter Notebooks*, if set up correctly, can also run R.

## Data Types (classes) in R
In R, variables are not declared as some data type, but instead variables are assigned as R objects and the data type of that R object becomes the data type or `class` of the variable. R `objects` include:

* Vectors
* Lists
* Matrices
* Arrays
* Factors
* Data Frames

The elemental R `objects` is the `vector`; vectors have six data types:

* `logical`
* `numeric`
* `integer`
* `complex`
* `charecter`
* `raw`  

Examples: 
```{R}
#'logical'
v <- TRUE 
print(class(v))
w <- T 
print(class(w))
```

```{R}
#'numeric`
v <- 23.5
print(class(v))
```

```{R}
#`integer`
v <- 2L
print(class(v))
```

```{R}
#`complex`
v <- 2+5i
print(class(v))
```

```{R}
#`character`	
v <- "TRUE"
print(class(v))
w <- "5"
print(class(v))
x <- "2.0"
print(class(v))
y <- "Apple"
print(class(v))
```

```{R}
#`raw`
v <- charToRaw("Hello")
print(class(v))
```

**Note**: In R, `NULL` represents the null or an empty object in R. `NA` represents a missing value in R. `NA` can be updated in R by *vectors*, *list* and other R objects whereas `NULL` cannot be coerced.

## Speaking of `R` Objects
As stated before, everything in R is an object, and in R nearly every object is made up of vectors. For example, `3` is a vector of length `one`, and type `charecter`.   

```{R}
class('3')
```

### Vectors
In R, vectors are typically composed using `c()`, which *combines* elements into a vector.

```{R}
# Create a vector
apple <- c('red','green',"yellow")
print(apple)
print(class(apple))
```

### Lists
A list is an R object which can contain different types of elements (vectors, functions, lists)

```{R}
# Create a list
list1 <- list(c(2,5,3),21.3,sin)
print(list1)
```

### Matrices
A matrix is a two-dimensional rectangular data set. 

```{r}
# Create a matrix
M = matrix( c('a','a','b','c','b','a'), nrow = 2, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
print(M)
```

### Arrays
Arrays are data sets of any dimensions. 

```{R}
# Create an array
# syntax: dim (cols, rows, # of arrays)
a <- array(c('green','yellow'),dim = c(3,3,2)) 
print(a)
```

### Factors
Factors stores distinct values of vector elements as labels. 

```{R}
# Add factors to a vector
apple_colors <- c('green','green','yellow','red','red','red','green')
factor_apple <- factor(apple_colors)
print(factor_apple)
print(nlevels(factor_apple))
```

### Data Frames
Data frames are spreadsheet data objects. The difference between a matrix and a data frame is that a data frame can have different forms of data. Another way to think about data frames are as lists of vectors of equal length.

```{R}
# Create the data frame
BMI <- 	data.frame(
   gender = c("Male", "Male","Female"), 
   height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
   weight = c(81,93, 78),
   Age = c(42,38,26)
)
print(BMI)
```

**Much more will be said and done with R objects in further lessons.**

## Operators and Expressions in R

* **Operators** are special symbols for simple actions, computations, and logic.
  + Arithmetic Operators
  + Relational Operators
  + Logical Operators
  + Assignment Operators
  + Miscellaneous Operators

**Note**: The same *operator* will behave differently when used with different *classes* of data.

### Arithmetic Operators
The first type of operators we will learn are the arithmetic operators:

* Addition, Subtraction: `+` `-`
* Multiplication: `*`
* Division: `/` 
* Modulus (remainder): `%%`
* Integer Division: `%?%`
* Exponentiation: `^`  or `**`  

```{R}
# Addition 
v <- c(2, 5.5, 6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v + t)
```

```{R}
# Subtraction
v <- c(2, 5.5, 6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v - t)
```

```{R}
# Multiplication
v <- c(2, 5.5, 6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v * t)
```

```{R}
# Division
v <- c(2, 5.5, 6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v / t)
```

```{R}
# Modulus
v <- c(2, 5.5, 6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v %% t)
```

```{R}
# Integer Division
v <- c(2, 5.5, 6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v %/% t)
```

```{R}
# Exponential
v <- c(2, 5.5 ,6)
t <- c(8, 3, 4)
print(v ^ t)
print(v ** t)
```

### Order of Operation
For expressions involving multiple operators, R follows an explicit ordering for evaluating each part:

  * `()`: Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want, starting from the inner most parentheses and working outward.

  * Unary operators (e.g., designating a negative number) have the next highest precedence.

  * `^` `**`: Exponentiation has the next highest precedence.

  * `*`, `/`: Multiplication and Division have the same precedence.

  * `+` and `-`: Addition and Subtraction have the same precedence.

Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation).
  
### Relational Operators

Greater Than `>`
Less Than `<`
Equal `==`
Less Than or Equal To `<=`
Great Than or Equal To `>=`
Not Equal `!=`

```{R}
# Greater Than
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v>t)
```

```{R}
# Less Than
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v < t)
```

```{R}
# Equal
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v == t)
```
```{R}
# Less Than or Equal To
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v<=t)
```

```{R}
# Great Than or Equal To
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v>=t)
```

```{R}
# Not Equal
v <- c(2,5.5,6,9)
t <- c(8,2.5,14,9)
print(v!=t)
```

### Logical Operators
AND `&` `&&` 
OR `|` `||`
NOT `!`

```{R}
# Both True (and) (vector)
v <- c(3,1,TRUE,2+3i)
t <- c(4,1,FALSE,2+3i)
print(v&t)
```

```{R}
# One True (or) (vector)
v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i)
t <- c(4,0,FALSE,2+3i)
print(v|t)
```

```{R}
# Not True
v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i)
print(!v)
```

```{R}
# Both True (and) (single value)
v <- c(3,0,TRUE,2+2i)
t <- c(1,3,TRUE,2+3i)
print(v&&t)
```

```{R}
# One True (or) (single value)
v <- c(0,0,TRUE,2+2i)
t <- c(0,3,TRUE,2+3i)
print(v||t)
```

### Assignment Operators
R gives you several assignment options. `<-` is considered the primary 'correct' operator. 

* `<-`
* `<<-`
* `=`
* `->`
* `->>`
* `assign(x, 'a')`

```{R}
v1 <- c(3,1,T,2+3i)
v2 <<- c(3,1,T,2+3i)
v3 = c(3,1,T,2+3i)
c(3,1,T,2+3i) -> v4
c(3,1,T,2+3i) ->> v5
assign("x", c(3,1,T,2+3i))
x
```

### Miscellaneous Operators
```{R}
# Sequencing - IMPORTANT - this is one of the most widespread operators in R!
v <- 2:8
print(v) 
```

```{R}
# Identify if an element belongs to a vector or data frame
v1 <- 8
v2 <- 12
t <- 1:10
print(v1 %in% t) 
print(v2 %in% t) 
```

```{R}
# Multiplies two matrices if they are conformable
M = matrix( c(2,6,5,1,10,4), nrow = 2,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)
t = M %*% t(M)
print(t)
```

## Coercion
A quick note on Coercion: Coercion can be thought of when the interpreter converts the data Type. 
In R there are two types of Coercion: 

* *Implicit* Coercion
* *Explicit* Coercion

### Explicit Coercion
*Explicit* coercion is the manual data class (type) reassignment via an R function.
```{R}
# numeric
x <- 0:6
class(x)
z<-as.numeric(x)
class(z)
```

```{R}
# numeric
x <- c('1', '2')
class(x)
z<-as.numeric(x)
class(z)
```

```{R}
# character 
x <- c(T,F)
class(x)
z<-as.character(x)
class(z)
```

```{R}
# logical 
x <- c(0, 1, 2)
class(x)
z<-as.logical(x)
class(z)
is.logical(z)
```

**Note**:You can't force everything:

```{R}
x <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
class(x)
z<-as.numeric(x)
class(z)
```
NA or missing. R is unable to coerce the data.  

### Implicit Coercion 
Implicit coercion is when the R interpreter automatically converts a data class 
```{R}
x <- c(1.7, 'a', T)
x
class(x)
```

## Variables in R
A variable in R can store a vector, group of vectors or a combination of R objects. 

### Identifiers
* An identifier is a sequence of characters to name a variable and other program elements

* A valid R identifier must:
  + consist of a combination of alphabets, numbers, dot(.) and underscore(_) characters. `var.1_`
  + start with letters or the dot characters `.var 
  + not include special characters: `var$1` is invalid
  + not start with numbers or underscore `2var` or `_var` is invalid

**Note**: a variable starting with a dot must be followed a letter `.app` is valid, `.3var` is invalid

## Reserved Words
An identifier that is used for a specific purpose by Python is called a **reserved word** or **keyword**.

`if` `else` `repeat` `while` `function` `for` `in` `next` `break` `T` `F`

`TRUE` `FALSE` `NULL` `Inf` `NaN` `NA` `NA_integer_` `NA_real_` `NA_complex_` `NA_character_` `...`

To see a list of reserved words in R, 
```{R}
help(reserved) 
#or
?reserved
```

## Control Structures in R
R has a four key *control structures*.

* `if` Statement: use it to execute a block of code, if a specified condition is true
* `else` Statement: use it to execute a block of code, if the same condition is false
* `else if` Statement: use it to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
* `ifelse()` Function: use it when to check the condition for every element of a vector

You can use the control statement `if` statement to execute a block of code if the condition is true.

**Note**: In R, any non-zero value is considered TRUE (even *negative* numbers), whereas a zero is considered FALSE.

```{R}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if(x + y) {
  print("True")
}
```

```{R}
# any non-zero value
if(-3) {
  print("True")
}
```

If you have only one statement curly braces are not required.

```{R}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if(x > y) print("x is greater")
```

You can write one `if` statement inside another `if` statement to test more than one condition and return different results.

```{R}
x <- 7
y <- 5
z <- 2
if(x > y && x > z) {
  if (y != z)
  print("x is greater")
}
```

Use `else` to execute a block of code if the condition is false.

```{R}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if(x > y) {
  print("x is greater")
} else {
  print("y is greater")
}
```

Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test if the first condition is 
false.

```{R}
x <- 5
y <- 5
if(x > y) {
  print("x is greater")
} else if(x < y) {
  print("y is greater")
} else {
  print("x and y are equal")
}
```

In R, you can use as many `else if` statements as you want in your program. However, when you want to make a series of decisions `switch()` may be a better choice.

If you have only one statement for `if` and one for `else`, R lets you use a single line.

```{R}
x <- 7
y <- 5
if (x > y) print("x is greater") else print("y is greater")
```

You can also use it to select variable assignment.

```{R}
x <- 7
y <- 5
max <- if (x > y) x else y
print(max)
```

The `ifelse()` function checks the condition for every element of a vector and selects those elements from the specified vector depending upon the result.

*syntax*: `ifelse(Condition, TrueVector, FalseVector)`

```{R}
v <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
w <- ifelse(v %% 2 == 0, "even", "odd")
print(w)
```

You can even use this function to choose values from two vectors.

```{R}
v1 <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
v2 <- c("a","b","c","d","e","f")
ifelse(c(TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE), v1, v2)
```

## Loops

### *While* Loops
A `while` loop is used when you want to perform a task until a specified  condition is met.

**Note**: Reminder, any non-zero value or nonempty container is considered `TRUE`; whereas *Zero*, *None*, and *empty* container is considered `FALSE`.

```{R}
# Iterate until x becomes 0
x <- 5
while (x) {
  print(x)
  x <- x - 1
}
```

If the condition is false at the start, the `while` loop never executes.

```{R}
x <- 0
while (x) {
  print(x)
  x <- x - 1
}
```

You can use the reserved word `break` to break out of the loop.

```{R}
# Break the loop when x becomes 3
x <- 6
while (x) {
  print(x)
  x <- x - 1
  if (x == 3)
    break
}
```

You can use the reserved work `next` to skip the current iteration and return to the next iteration in the loop. 

```{R}
# Skip odd numbers using continue statement
x <- 6
while (x) {
  x <- x - 1
  if (x %% 2 != 0)
    next
  print(x)
}
```

### *For* Loops
The `for` statement in R is a slightly different than traditional `for` loops in other languages. Instead of iterating over a numeric progression, in R `for` iterates over the items within of a *vector* or a *list*. Iterations progress in the order of the elements within the vector.

```{R}
# Iterate through a vector
colors <- c("red","green","blue","yellow")
for (x in colors) {
  print(x)
}
```

```{R}
# Iterate through a list
l <- list(3.14, "Hi", c(1,2,3))
for (x in l) {
  print(x)
}
```

### Sequencing 

If you need to execute a group of statements for a specified number of times, use sequence operator `:` or the `seq()`

```{R}
# Print 'Hello!' 3 times
for (x in 1:3) {
  print("Hello!")
}
```

```{R}
# Iterate a sequence and square each element
for (x in seq(from=2,to=8,by=2)) {
  print(x^2)
}
```

If you have only one statement to execute curly braces are not required, 

```{R}
# Print the numbers 0 to 4
for (x in 0:4) print(x)
```
```{R}
for(x in 1:3) {
  for(y in 1:2) {
    print(paste(x, y))
  }
}
```

### **Repeat** Loops
A `repeat` loop in R repeats a block of code indefinitely. In this loop, no condition checking is performed in order to end the loop. A `reapt` loop
**requires a condition explicitly inside it with `break` statement**, without it, you will have **an infinite loop**.

```{R}
# Iterate until x becomes 5
x <- 1
repeat {
  print(x)
  if (x > 4)
    break
  x <- x + 1
}
```
