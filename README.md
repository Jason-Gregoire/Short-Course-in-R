# Short_Course_in_R
This a short course in R created iso data science course course taught in Python. 

The goal of short course in R is to provide students of *CY3650 Cyber Data Management and Analytics* a survey of methods and tools in R to handle all CY3650 concepts and practicals taught in the Python programming language.

## Short Course Struture
The short course is composed of four parts:

* **Part1**

  1.1: Introduction and Basics of R 
  
  1.2: Vectors and Strings in R
  
  1.3: Lists, Arrays, Matrices, Arrays, Factors, & Data Frames in R

* **Part2**

  2.1: Functions in R
  
  2.2: Packages, Variable Scope, and Namespace in R
  
  2.3: Working with Data Files in R
  
  2.4: Working with Files and Directories in R

* **Part4**

  4.1: Data Analysis in R - Data Frames
  
  4.2 Data Frame Manipulations & Basic Data Visualization in R
  
  4.3: Access and Use ExternalDBs with SQL in R

**Note**: Naming approach is based on CY3650 modules. **__There is no Part3__**

## Course Environemnt:

The R markdown files are best reviewed and manipulated in R's IDE, R Studio.
